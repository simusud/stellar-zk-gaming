//! # Zk Game Theory Game
//!
//! A simple two-player guessing game where players guess a number between 1 and 10.
//! The player whose guess is closest to the randomly generated number wins.
//!
//! **Game Hub Integration:**
//! This game is Game Hub-aware and enforces all games to be played through the
//! Game Hub contract. Games cannot be started or completed without points involvement.
